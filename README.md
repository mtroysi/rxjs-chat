This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


Please be aware that the structure of the project is not yet optimized, this is WIP.

## Start the server
`node src/server.js`

If you want to chat with other people and make your local server accessible, run the following command :  
`yarn run ngrok`  
and replace the url in `src/App.js` by the ngrok url

## Start the client
`yarn start`
