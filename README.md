This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


Please be aware that the structure of the project is not yet optimized, this is WIP.

## Start the server
`node src/server.js`

If you want to chat with other people and make your local server accessible, run the following command :  
`yarn run ngrok`  
and give the generated url to the users who will put it in `src/constants.js` instead of `localhost` in `SOCKET`

## Start the client
`yarn start`
